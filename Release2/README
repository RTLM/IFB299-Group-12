I created the entire powerpoint of the ‘R2.pdf’ document.

I completed almost all of the user story checks in the ‘UserStoryCheck.docx’ document.

I re-wrote the existing business letter we had. The ‘BusinessLetter-Formatted.pdf’ document. I wrote the last 4 out of the 10 paragraphs of the document and edited and proofread any of the paragraphs that I didn’t write myself.
