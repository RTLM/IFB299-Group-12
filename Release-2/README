I wrote all of the ‘Website feedback – week 11.pdf’ document.

I answered almost all of the questions in the ‘PeerReview2.pdf’ document. I edited and proofread any questions I didn’t answer.

I re-wrote the existing business letter we had. The ‘BusinessLetter-Formatted.pdf’ document. 
I wrote the first 6 out of the 10 paragraphs of the document and edited and proofread any of the other paragraphs that I didn’t write
on my own.

The two folders show before and after images of the website. The before images are what the web pages were before I edited them. 
The after images show my contribution to the web pages and how I edited them.
